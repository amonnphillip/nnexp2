neural network experiment 1

Written from scratch, this is an implementation of a neural network. In this implementation I use sigmoid neurons and train the network using the backpropagation method.

I train the network against a very small data set. The data simply trains the network to respond to (categorize) the input signal with a signal on one of its outputs. After the training the results of the tests are shown against each training data set. Error numbers close to 0 means the training was pretty successful.

To run you need to have nodejs installed (v4.2.4 +). From the command line type node index.js
