neural network experiment 2, deep learning

A neural network is trained to navigate an area towards a fixed goal. Here we use a deep q learning algorithm variant based on the paper http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602v1.pdf.


To run you need to have nodejs installed (v4.2.4 +). From the command line type node index.js
